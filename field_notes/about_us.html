  <h1>Hello, stranger!</h1>

  <div id="aboutus"<p> If you have landed on our page it means you must be a fellow enthusiast for picnics, or maybe just someone looking to escape the chaos of city life for a few hours. <br />
     We understand you perfectly, and that is how this website was born. Sometimes life can feel very intense and there is no better way to recharge than lay in the field, open a bottle of wine and soak up the sunrays while enjoying company and good food.
   This is the sound proof method to recover from life that Emma, Siiri and Carolina experienced during their first year of university and that is why this website was born. We want to share with whomever needs a timeout from the crowds where to find the best spots in Bath to have a picnic.
 Whether you are going there by yourself, you are taking the kids on a new adventure or you are going on a date with your soul mate here you can find which one is the closest field to you and the one with the best view.
<br />
More about us? The three of us met in the first year of University in lectures. We are all management students and are looking to make the most out of university years.
<br />
Drop us an email and let us know if you have any suggestions, you recommend any new fields in Bath that we should try, or even if you just want to say "hi". We will be happy to reply. Enjoy you stay on Field Notes. <center> Emma, Siiri, and Carolina </center>  </p>
